    "Ini merupakan cubaan kali ketiga Najib untuk menggugurkan Sri Ram sebagai pendakwa dalam kes jenayah berkaitan 1MDB itu. Sebelum ini, satu permohonan difailkan dalam satu lagi kes 1MDB di hadapan hakim berbeza dan cubaan kedua menerusi prosiding sivil.\n",
    "Ketika menolak permohonan Ahli Parlimen Pekan itu, Hakim Mahkamah Tinggi Mohamed Zaini Mazlan berkata dakwaan Najib bahawa Sri Ram terlibat dalam siasatan terhadapnya sebagai tidak ada merit.\n",

    "“Isu ini sudah dibincangkan dan diputuskan. Keputusan oleh mahkamah lain sebelum ini kekal dan tidak boleh diterbalikkan,” kata hakim.\n",

    "“Seperti juga individu lain, Sri Ram berhak mempunyai pandangan peribadi. Itu sahaja. Namun, pertimbangan berbeza akan dibuat jika beliau menunjukkan sikap berat sebelah semasa melaksanakan tugas sebagai pendakwa raya kanan. Pandangan peribadi beliau tidak boleh dianggap akan menghalang tanggungjawab beliau sebagai pendakwa raya kanan.\n",
    "“Tambahan pula, kejadian itu, seperti yang dikemukakan oleh responden, berlaku ketika sebelum pelantikan Sri Ram sebagai pendakwa raya kanan. Turut penting ialah pemohon tidak membuat sebarang aduan mengenai tindak-tanduk Sri Ram ketika menjalankan perbicaraan melibatkan pemohon. Ini mengukuhkan hujah responden bahawa Sri Ram bersikap terbuka semasa menjalankan tugas sebagai pendakwa raya kanan,” kata hakim.\n",
    "Mohamed Zaini seterusnya berkata pada akhirnya, mahkamah bertanggungjawab memastikan sesebuah perbicaraan dilaksanakan secara adil demi mendapatkan keadilan.\n",

    "3 Ogos 2018 – Kajian terbaharu yang dijalankan oleh University College London (UCL) mendapati khidmat penjagaan kesihatan mental daripada pekerja sokongan (support worker) yang pernah mengharungi sendiri penyakit ini mungkin boleh membantu mengurangkan kebarangkalian pesakit yang baru keluar dari penjagaan kesihatan mental akut (acute mental health care) daripada dimasukkan semula ke unit berkenaan.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Kertas penyelidikan tersebut yang diterbitkan pada hari ini dalam jurnal The Lancet mendapati bilangan pesakit mental yang dimasukkan semula ke unit penjagaan akut dalam tempoh setahun ialah 24% jauh lebih rendah bagi kumpulan pesakit yang ditawarkan pekerja sokongan berbentuk rakan senasib, berbanding dengan kumpulan pesakit yang hanya diberi buku kerja pemulihan peribadi sahaja.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "“Pesakit yang dibenarkan keluar (discharge) dari perkhidmatan krisis komuniti sering dimasukkan semula ke unit penjagaan akut. Ini bukan sahaja membantutkan pemulihan, malah menggunapakai sumber yang sepatutnya dikhususkan untuk penambahbaikan jangka panjang fungsi dan kualiti hidup pesakit. Pekerja sokongan daripada golongan rakan senasib berupaya memberikan sokongan dan dorongan yang benar-benar mesra dan berempati kerana ianya datang daripada pengalaman peribadi mereka sendiri, di samping menjadi contoh tauladan (role model) yang baik untuk pemulihan pesakit,” kata pengarang utama, Profesor Sonia Johnson (Psikiatri, UCL).\n",
    "\n",
    "Di United Kingdom (UK), lebih separuh daripada jumlah pesakit yang dimasukkan ke unit penjagaan akut dimasukkan semula ke unit berkenaan dalam tempoh setahun, namun tiada bukti kukuh yang menjelaskan kaedah untuk mengurangkan jumlah ini.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Sebenarnya, sokongan daripada individu yang pernah mengalami masalah kesihatan mental telah dipraktikkan dalam program seperti Pelaksanaan Pemulihan melalui Perubahan Organisasi NHS (UK) dan juga Pelan Tindakan Pemulihan Kesihatan Amerika Syarikat. Penyelidikan ini merupakan ujian terkawal rawak pertama yang seumpamanya untuk menilai keberkesanan program sokongan rakan senasib. Walaupun begitu, masih banyak penyelidikan yang perlu dijalankan sebelum strategi ini boleh dilaksanakan secara menyeluruh di UK, contohnya untuk memahami sebab-sebab mengapa program ini berkesan.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Pastinya, campur tangan atau intervensi dalam pengurusan kendiri (self-management) mungkin boleh membantu pesakit menguruskan kesihatan mental mereka dengan lebih baik. Dalam kajian ini, penyelidik menyediakan peserta sama ada dengan buku kerja pemulihan peribadi sahaja (220 orang) atau buku kerja berserta bantuan pekerja sokongan rakan senasib (221 orang). Peserta juga dibenarkan meneruskan penjagaan biasa mereka.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Kajian ini dijalankan menerusi enam buah pasukan penyelesaian krisis kesihatan mental (crisis resolution team) di England dan peserta dipilih hanya selepas mereka dibenarkan keluar dari unit krisis oleh pasukan penyelesaian krisis. Peserta kajian terdiri daripada pelbagai diagnosis antaranya termasuk skizofrenia, bipolar, psikosis, kemurungan, kecelaruan keresahan, kecelaruan stres pascatrauma (PTSD), dan kecelaruan personaliti.\n",

    "Peserta yang menerima sokongan rakan senasib ditawarkan 10 sesi pertemuan mingguan selama satu jam. Dalam sesi pertemuan ini, pekerja sokongan mendengar masalah peserta dan bermatlamat menyemaikan harapan dengan berkongsi kemahiran dan strategi pengurusan penyakit (coping strategies) yang dikuasai sewaktu mereka sendiri berada dalam proses pemulihan. Kesemua pekerja sokongan diberikan latihan terlebih dahulu dalam kemahiran mendengar, kesedaran budaya, pendedahan kendiri, dan kerahsiaan, serta cara menggunakan buku kerja.\n",

    "Selepas tamat tempoh satu tahun, kajian mendapati peratusan kemasukan semula ke unit penjagaan akut adalah lebih rendah bagi kumpulan peserta yang menerima intervensi berbanding dengan kelompok kawalan— dengan 29% peserta dimasukkan semula setelah menerima sokongan rakan senasib, berbanding dengan 38% peserta yang hanya menerima buku kerja.\n",

    "“Kami sedia maklum bahawa banyak pengguna perkhidmatan penjagaan krisis kesihatan mental merasakan perkhidmatan ini terhenti secara mendadak kerana kurangnya penjagaan susulan yang siap sedia. Kajian kami menunjukkan bahawa pekerja sokongan rakan senasib dapat membantu mengisi kelompangan ini dengan membantu pengguna perkhidmatan (pesakit) membangunkan strategi pengurusan kendiri dan pelan pemulihan dengan cara tersendiri dan lebih bermakna, seterusnya dapat membantu pesakit terus bertahan sesudah berlakunya sesuatu krisis,” kata pengarang bersama, Dr Brynmor Lloyd-Evans (Psikiatri, UCL).\n",
